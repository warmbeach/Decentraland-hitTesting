# Decentraland-hitTesting
Create a model in Blender and then interact with it from a scene in Decentraland

First, we need a model to do testing on.  If you dont already have it, go to https://www.blender.org/download/ and get the latest version of blender.  Its free, its full of features, and it creates the types of files needed in Decentraland.

Open blender and click on New File -> General:

When the new file opens, a cube will be selected (highlighted with orange around the edges).  Hit the "X" key and confirm that you want to delete the cube:

Click on Add -> Mesh -> Grid to get a new grid that we can use to create various areas to hit test on:
