1) Install Node if you dont already have it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2) create a working folder for your decentraland project

    Mac - open Terminal
  
    Windows - open `node.js command prompt` from the Start Menu
  
    Both - type `mkdir decentraland`
  
    Both - type `cd decentraland`
  
3) initialize a Decentraland scene in your new folder by typing `npm install -g decentraland`
