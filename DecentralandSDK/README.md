Getting started with the Decentraland SDK can be quite simple.  They have a great guide at https://docs.decentraland.org/development-guide/SDK-101/ that you can check out, or you can follow these steps below:

1) Install Node if you dont already have it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2) Install Visual Studio code from https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3) create a working folder for your decentraland project

    Mac - open Terminal
  
    Windows - open `node.js command prompt` from the Start Menu

    Mac and Windows - type `mkdir decentraland`
  
    Mac and Windows - type `cd decentraland`
  
4) get the Decentraland SDK by typing `npm install -g decentraland`

    you may see messages similar to these which can be ignored

5) run `dcl init` to intialize a new decentraland scene

6) Make Chrome or Firefox your default browser (Recommended)

6) From Terminal or command prompt run `dcl start`


A new tab in your browser should open and you should be able to walk around using the following keys:

`W` - forward

`S` - backward

`A` - left

`D` - right


Clicking and moving your mouse inside the window will also let you look around.  Hit the `esc` key when you are ready to exit and close the tab.

Now lets modify the code...
